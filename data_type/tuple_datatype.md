# ðŸ”— Python Tuple Data Type

A **tuple** is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection in Python. Tuples are similar to lists, but once created, their elements cannot be changed. Tuples are often used to represent fixed collections of items.

## ðŸ§± Creating a Tuple

```python
my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(my_tuple)
```

**Output:**
```
('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
```

---

## ðŸ§° Common Tuple Operations

### 1. Accessing Elements
```python
t = ("nginx", "docker", "git")
print(t[0])    # First element
print(t[-1])   # Last element
```

**Output:**
```
nginx
git
```

---

### 2. Tuple Unpacking
```python
name, tool, version = ("docker", "container", "24.0")
print(f"{name} is a {tool} engine (v{version})")
```

**Output:**
```
docker is a container engine (v24.0)
```

---

### 3. Length of a Tuple
```python
t = ("a", "b", "c", "d")
print(len(t))
```

**Output:**
```
4
```

---

### 4. Membership Test
```python
services = ("nginx", "mysql", "docker")
print("mysql" in services)
print("redis" in services)
```

**Output:**
```
True
False
```

---

### 5. Nested Tuples
```python
inventory = ("web", ("web01", "web02"), "db")
print(inventory[1])
print(inventory[1][0])
```

**Output:**
```
('web01', 'web02')
web01
```

## ðŸ”§ DevOps Use Cases with Tuples

### Example 1: Immutable Service Configuration
```python
service = ("nginx", "1.18", "running")
print(f"Service: {service[0]}, Version: {service[1]}, Status: {service[2]}")
```

**Output:**
```
Service: nginx, Version: 1.18, Status: running
```

---

### Example 2: Returning Multiple Values from a Function
```python
def get_service_status():
    return ("docker", "running")

name, status = get_service_status()
print(f"{name} is {status}")
```

**Output:**
```
docker is running
```

---

### Example 3: Logging Fixed Structure Data
```python
log_entry = ("2025-07-11", "web01", "deployed")
print("Log:", log_entry)
```

**Output:**
```
Log: ('2025-07-11', 'web01', 'deployed')
```

---

### Example 4: Read-only Server Info
```python
server_info = ("web01", "192.168.1.10", "Ubuntu 22.04")
for item in server_info:
    print(item)
```

**Output:**
```
web01
192.168.1.10
Ubuntu 22.04
```

## âœ… Summary of Tuple Features

| Feature             | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Ordered             | Maintains the order of elements            |
| Immutable           | Cannot be changed after creation           |
| Allows Duplicates   | Elements can repeat                        |
| Supports Indexing   | Access elements by index                   |
| Faster than Lists   | Due to immutability                        |

**Tuples** are especially useful in DevOps when you need to store grouped data that should not be altered, such as service configurations, constant mappings, or structured log entries.
